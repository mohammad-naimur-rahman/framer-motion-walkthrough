# Framer motion walkthrough

###### Framer motion is a very popular react animation library. In this repository, I will walk through framer motion documentations and will test things out in different components in this app. This project will be like a guide and cheat sheet for future usage and revision.

```
git clone https://github.com/mohammad-naimur-rahman/framer-motion-walkthrough

_Other things will be added later in this section_
